    ## Roadmap

    #### &#x2611; Release Model on HuggingFace
      - Continually retrain and update both segmentation and text-recognition models as more training data becomes available.

    #### &#x2610; Release Training and Eval data on HuggingFace

    #### &#x2610; Specialized TrOCR Model
      - Train a TrOCR model specialized on Swedish historical handwritten text.
      - Initialize with a historical BERT-model trained at the Swedish National Archives.
    
    #### &#x2610; Open-source and package HTR-pipeline for mass HTR
      - Develop an easy-to-implement pipeline like the demo.
      - Ensure high modularity: 
        - Different segmentation strategies.
        - Integration of models from various frameworks.
        - Effective evaluation methods for entire pipelines and their comparisons.
      - Broad use-cases: Not just running text, but all types of handwritten archives.

    #### &#x2610; Inference Endpoints
      - Serve model through inference APIs / Rest APIs with dedicated hardware.
