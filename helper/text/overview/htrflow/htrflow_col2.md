## Source Code

Please fork and leave a star on Github if you like it! The code for this project can be found here:

- [Github](https://github.com/Riksarkivet/HTRFLOW)

**Note**: We will in the future package all of the code for mass HTR (batch inference on multi-GPU setup), but the code is still work in progress.

## Models

The models used in this demo are very much a work in progress, and as more data, and new architectures, becomes available, they will be retrained and reevaluated. For more information about the models, please refer to their model-cards on Huggingface.
