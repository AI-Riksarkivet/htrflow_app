## Introduction

The Swedish National Archives introduces a demonstrational end-to-end HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) pipeline. This pipeline comprises two instance segmentation models: one designated for segmenting text-regions and another for isolating text-lines within these regions, coupled with an HTR model for image-to-text transcription. The objective of this project is to establish a generic pipeline capable of processing running-text documents spanning from 1600 to 1900.

## Usage

It's crucial to emphasize that this application serves primarily for demonstration purposes, aimed at showcasing the various models employed in the current workflow for processing documents with running-text. <br>
