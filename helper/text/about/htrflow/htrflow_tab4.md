### HTR

For the text-recognition a SATRN model was trained with mmocr on approximately one million handwritten text-line images ranging from 1600 to 1900. It was trained on a wide variety of archival material to make it generalize as well as possible. See below for detailed evaluation results, and also some finetuning experiments.
