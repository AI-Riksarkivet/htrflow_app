## Source Code

Please fork and leave a star on Github if you like it! The code for this project can be found here:

- [Github](https://github.com/Borg93/htr_gradio)
  **Note**: We will in the future package all of the code for mass htr (batch inference on multi-GPU setup), but the code is still work in progress.

## Models

The models within this pipeline will be subject to continual retraining and updates as more data becomes accessible. For detailed information about all the models used in this project, please refer to the model cards available on Hugging Face:

- [Riksarkivet/rtmdet_lines](https://huggingface.co/Riksarkivet/rtmdet_lines)
- [Riksarkivet/satrn_htr](https://huggingface.co/https://huggingface.co/Riksarkivet/satrn_htr)

## Datasets

Both train and evaluation datasets for the models will be released in the future here:

- [Riksarkivet/placeholder_region_segmentation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Riksarkivet/placeholder_region_segmentation)
- [Riksarkivet/placeholder_line_segmentation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Riksarkivet/placeholder_line_segmentation)
