# HTRFLOW.app: A demo app for HTR
We're thrilled to introduce  [HTRFLOW.app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Riksarkivet/htr_demo), our demonstration platform that brings to life the process of transcribing Swedish handwritten documents from the 17th to the 19th century.

HTRFLOW is designed to provide users with a step-by-step visualization of the HTR-process, and offer non-expert users an inside look into the workings of an AI-transcription pipeline.
At the moment HTRFLOW is mainly a demo-application. Itâ€™s not intended for production, but instead to showcase the immense possibilities that HTR-technology is opening up for cultural heritage institutions around the world.
All code is open-source, all our models are on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/Riksarkivet/models-for-handwritten-text-recognition-652692c6871f915e766de688) and are free to use, and all data will be made available for download and use.

HTRFLOW is more than just a demo; it's a testament to the open source development of HTR. As we progress, HTRFLOW will evolve into multiple part e.g. HTRFLOW.core, our foundational library that will serve as the backbone for a range of applications in the transcription domain. Note that the backend (src) for the app will be rewritten and packaged to be more optimized under the project name [HTR_SVEA](https://github.com/Borg93/htr_svea).
