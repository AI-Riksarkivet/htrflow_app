## HTRflow Demo  

This web application is developed by the **National Archives of Sweden** as part of [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se/)

With this demo, users can explore step by step how **AI transforms historical manuscripts into digital text**. Behind the scenes, it runs our open-source **Python package** [HTRflow](https://ai-riksarkivet.github.io/htrflow/latest). Both the app and HTRflowâ€™s code are fully open source.

### How It Works  
The demo follows a simple three-step workflow:

1. **Upload** - Upload your own image and run HTRflow on it.  
2. **Results** â€“ View the transcribed text generated by HTRflow.  
3. **Export** â€“ Select your preferred format and download the results.  

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This is a **demo application** and is not intended for production use.
