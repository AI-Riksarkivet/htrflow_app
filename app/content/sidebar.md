## HTRflow Demo

Welcome to the **HTRflow Demo** ‚Äì a web application developed by the **National Archives of Sweden** in collaboration with [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se/).

> Note: This demo application is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for production use.
> The application is hosted on Hugging Face ü§ó using shared infrastructure, which means there is a daily quota limit on how much you can use the app each day.
