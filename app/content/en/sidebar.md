## ATR-demo
Developed by the **National Archives of Sweden** with [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se/) that demonstrates AI-powered conversion of historical manuscripts to digital text using [HTRflow](https://ai-riksarkivet.github.io/htrflow/latest).

> Note: This demo application is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for production use. The application is hosted on Hugging Face 🤗 using shared infrastructure, which means there is a daily quota limit on how much you can use the app each day.

Both the App and HTRflow's code are completely open source. Explore and contribute on GitHub:

- [APP](https://github.com/AI-Riksarkivet/htrflow_app).
- [HTRflow](https://ai-riksarkivet.github.io/htrflow/latest).
